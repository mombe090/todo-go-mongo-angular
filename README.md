    - update the MONGOHOST and MONGOPORT by yours in the .env file
    - ```
            docker build -t name-of-your-image .
      ```
    - ```
            docker run -n name-of-your-container -d -p 8090:8090 name-of-your-image
      ```
      Here we go, you can test it on http://localhost:8090/todos
      
* With Docker-Compose

             docker stack deploy -c docker-stack.ym todo   
       ```  
        Here we go, you can test it on http://localhost:8090/todos


## UP AND RUN WITH GOLANG CLI

* How to build the application using the cli
    - update the MONGOHOST and MONGOPORT by yours in the .env file
    - ```
            cd backend
